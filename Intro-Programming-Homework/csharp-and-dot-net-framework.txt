C# is a new programming language from Microsoft designed specifically to target the .NET Framework. 
Microsoft's .NET Framework is a runtime environment and class library that dramatically simplifies 
the development and deployment of modern, component-based applications. The Microsoft .NET Framework 
consists of two elements: a runtime environment called the Common Language Runtime (CLR), 
and a class library called the Framework Class Library (FCL).
